# Project-3

## Poll.io - A React application for creating polls and surveys to share with your friends

Poll.io uses passport authentication for user sign up, and connects users to a social media type platform to see polls and surveys of relevant topics displayed. The user has the ability to create polls of any category of their choosing, and these are placed and accessed according to each category through our UI. Our app features the ability to comment on each poll, and can generate individual links so that the poll can be shared
